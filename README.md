# Doppler imaging with Maximum Entropy

Repository for IGRINS Doppler imaging codes in Chen et al 2024. 

To run the codes, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required packages in `requirements.txt`. This can be done by running the set up script `setup_env.sh` (run `chmod +x setup_env.sh` first).

The code is tested on python3.9.6 only.
